    "- **Replit, v0, lovable** — first attempt\n",
    "- **Lovable** — fastest visually appealing result\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Worked\n",
    "- Got a working flight tracker UI pretty quickly\n",
    "- Basic layout and styling came together fast\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where It Broke\n",
    "1. **Chrome Dino game is complex** — hundreds of lines of game logic, not something an LLM writes correctly from scratch\n",
    "2. **Flight APIs not supported** — Replit, Lovable, and similar platforms weren't able to figure out FlightAware or similar APIs\n",
    "3. **Base64 Images** - LLM got stuck trying to copy GIANT chunks of base64 images, when it could have just pointed to the the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson**: No-code tools are great for prototyping standard UI patterns. They struggle with complex game logic and API integrations that require env vars.\n"

    "1. Found the extracted Dino game source code online\n",
    "2. Asked Cursor to integrate it by copying the code\n",
