    "## 1. REST (Representational State Transfer)\n",

    "GET /books/123\n",

    "{ book(id: 123) { title, price } }\n",

    "{\"method\": \"get_book\", \"params\": [123], \"id\": 1}\n",

    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "socket.send(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "// Server can reply immediately, anytime\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Use Case:** Live chat apps (like Slack/Discord), multiplayer games, or live stock market tickers.\n",

    "Each protocol has its sweet spot. REST remains king for public APIs due to its simplicity and ubiquity. gRPC dominates in performance-critical microservices. GraphQL shines when frontend teams need flexibility. JSON-RPC is the go-to for blockchain and emerging AI tool ecosystems. And WebSockets are unbeatable for anything real-time.\n",
