    "# 🧠 A Practical Guide to CS Fundamentals, Python Tricks & Interview-Ready Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of software engineering, fundamentals are not optional—they’re foundational. Whether you’re preparing for a technical interview or just brushing up on core concepts, revisiting the essentials can be a career-defining move. This post is a curated walkthrough of CS fundamentals, Pythonic tools, and best practices—designed to be both a refresher and a launchpad.\n",

    "## 📌 The Interview Mindset: Think Before You Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into syntax or data structures, let’s talk about approach. In interviews, it’s not just about solving the problem—it’s about how you solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Coding Best Practices to Keep in Mind:\n",
    "- **Clarify the problem**: Don’t assume. Ask about edge cases, constraints, and input types.\n",
    "- **Think out loud**: Your thought process is as important as your final answer.\n",
    "- **Start with brute force**: Then optimize. Show your evolution.\n",
    "- **Write readable code**: Use meaningful variable names and modular functions.\n",
    "- **Test manually**: Walk through your code with sample inputs.\n",
    "- **Explain trade-offs**: Time vs. space, readability vs. performance.\n",

    "## 🧱 Design Patterns: The Architecture of Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They’re not code templates—they’re mental models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Patterns to Know:\n",
    "- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance.\n",
    "- **Factory**: Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic.\n",
    "- **Observer**: One-to-many dependency between objects.\n",
    "- **Strategy**: Encapsulates interchangeable behaviors.\n",
    "- **Decorator**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing when and why to use these patterns can elevate your design discussions in interviews.\n",
