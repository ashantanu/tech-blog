Instruction tuning involves training a model on a series of instructions prompts, typically covering a wide variety of tasks. The resulting instruction-tuned model then tends to generate useful responses to zero-shot prompts across a variety of tasks.” - Google Dev Page",

But it is possible to squeeze out more performance by methods like instruction tuning that allow few-shot learning (also called in-context learning; ICL) and zero-shot learning. This way, user can provide prompts with instructions and expect model to perform tasks accordingly.\nThink pretraining as barebones for building world knowledge and instruction tuning as lessons on problem solving.",

I took a screenshot of the day’s lineup and used ChatGPT to extract the artist names into a JSON file:\n[\n    \"Artist Name 1\",\n    \"Artist Name 2\",\n    \"Artist Name 3\"\n]\n\n\nStep 2: Spotify Integration\nThe core functionality uses the Spotify API to: - Search for each artist - Get their top tracks - Create and populate a playlist\nHere’s the key Spotify-related code:\n\ndef get_artist_id(sp, artist_name):\n    results = handle_spotify_rate_limits(sp.search, q=artist_name, type='artist', limit=1)\n    items = results.get('artists', {}).get('items', []) if results else []\n    if items:\n        return items[0]['id']\n    print(f\"❌ Artist not found: {artist_name}\")\n    return None\n\ndef get_top_tracks(sp, artist_id, market='US'):\n    result = handle_spotify_rate_limits(sp.artist_top_tracks, artist_id, country=market)\n    if not result:\n        return []\n    \n    tracks = []\n    for track in result['tracks'][:MAX_SONGS_PER_ARTIST]:\n        tracks.append({\n            'uri': track['uri'],\n            'name': track['name'],\n            'artist': track['artists'][0]['name']\n        })\n    return tracks\n\n\n\nStep 3: YouTube Integration\nWhy stop at spotify, let’s add YouTube support: - Create a matching YouTube playlist - Uses Brave Search API for efficient video discovery - youtube search API takes up a lot of daily quota - Manages YouTube API quotas to prevent hitting limits\n\ndef search_youtube_video(query):\n    \"\"\"Search for a YouTube video using Brave Search API.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        search_query = f\"site:youtube.com/watch {query} official\"\n        encoded_query = quote_plus(search_query)\n        \n        response = requests.get(\n            BRAVE_SEARCH_API_URL,\n            headers=BRAVE_SEARCH_HEADERS,\n            params={\n                \"q\": search_query,\n                \"count\": 1,\n                \"safesearch\": \"moderate\"\n            }\n        )\n        \n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            data = response.json()\n            if data.get('web', {}).get('results'):\n                video_url = data['web']['results'][0]['url']\n                return video_url\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"❌ Error searching for video: {e}\")\n    return None\n\n\n\nStep 4: Progress Tracking and Error Handling\nTo make the script robust and resumable: - Saves progress in a JSON file - Tracks processed tracks to avoid duplicates - Manages API quotas - Handles rate limits and errors gracefully - Can run again to resume progress of long playlist uploads\n\ndef load_progress():\n    if os.path.exists(PROGRESS_FILE):\n        with open(PROGRESS_FILE, 'r') as f:\n            return json.load(f)\n    return {\n        'spotify_playlist_id': None,\n        'youtube_playlist_id': None,\n        'processed_tracks': [],\n        'quota_used': 0,\n        'last_reset': datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n    }",

    "text": "Why RLHF?\nThe objective of any model is to achieve the desired output given an input. We design an “objective function” that tells the model what should be the desired output. This gets tricky with generative models where output is unbounded text and there simply isn’t an easy way to reliably signal. For example ‘this is good’ and ‘it’s great’ would sound similar to us but absolutely not to the objective functions we use.\nThus, to best align a model with the desired outcome/behavior we use RLHF.\nIt also enables us to “align” a model with human values without a need to define an objective function for those values. Just tell the model your preferences and the model will adjust to them.\nWhy did we not do this, to begin with? Simple answer - it needs the powerful pretrained LLMs that we have these days. Small models are simply not capable enough to learn well from RLHF. Moreover, RLHF itself is relatively new and researchers are trying to understand how it works and what is actually needed to make it work. Could be that we see much smaller models perform spectacularly with a newer RLHF in the coming years.",

GPT3, Falcon, Gopher etc)\nInstruct Tune this LLM to get a Supervised fine tuned model (Falcon-Instruct)\nTrain a Reward Model (more on this later)\nFinetune SFT with RL to get your Final Model\n\nThis setup is best described in the diagram (from Chip Huyen’s blog, OpenAI paper) below\n\n\n\nFrom Chip Huyen’s blog\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom OpenAI paper\n\n\n\n\nReward Model\nWe train a model to take in a (prompt, output) pair and give a score. This score is a scalar reward that represents the human preference for the output given the prompt. This model is used as a proxy for human feedback in our RLHF setup.\nThe training data is collected using human annotators in a interesting setup. For a input prompt, we generate multiple outputs. Instead of asking annotators to score each pair, we ask them to rank these outputs. There are many methods to do this. One example is showing two generated texts and asking using to choose the better pair which will ultimately give us a ranking. These ranks can then be converted into a scalar reward.\n\n\nRL step\nNow we have a SFT and reward model. For each training example, use SFT (agent) to generate an output (action), reward model to generate a scalar reward, and proximal policy optimization (PPO) (optimizer algo) to update SFT model.\n\n\n\nFrom OpenAI Paper",

Love how I can break down things into little cells of their own and keep going compartmentalizing my blog. Into folders, into cells and into my mind. All along with the incredible power of python. And the great thing about it is that you can hos tit on github pages too! free free free!\n\nNBDEV\nHere’s the post that led me to it. Huge shoutout to Jonathan Soma’s blog (please check it out it is amaaazing). This blog eventually led me to nbdev and here I am.\n\n\nHow to use it?\nHonestly, you just need to follow their tutorial and you are good to go. It covers everything about setting up a repository to writing your notebooks. It is wordy and if you want to me write a cut-to-the-chase version then let me know in the comments!\nDon’t forget to leverage the powerful formatting with quatro that is that is the backbone of this setup. Nbdev is using quatro to convert these cheeky notebooks into pretty blogposts. So create a _quatro.yml file in your nbs folder. Head over to quatro docs for the REAL documentation that helps you customize easily.\nI enabled sidebar, comments, theme and other customizations thanks to quatro docs. Needless to say, I LOVE playing around with these customizations and I hope you do too!\n\n\nRedirecting to your page\nGo to settings of your repository, Pages section of the left panel and enter your domain name in the custom domain box. Give it a few minutes to verify and them see your changes reflected!\nHowever, whenever I made a commit to my github repo, github build would reset my CNAME and I would have to go back and update it again. To my help came this nice github discussion. Simply create a CNAME file with the subdomain you want to redirect to. For example I use blog.ashantanu.com. I had to add this CNAME record on my domain registry (GoDaddy, NameCheap, Wix or whereever you purchased your domain name from).\n\n\nAlternatives\n\nGithub Pages with Jekyll I have gone over almost every jekyll theme in hopes of getting it right and bending it to my will. I tried the barber theme (great aesthetics) and teXt theme. Both incredible, spent infinite time working on them but maintaining them was SO tough. Constantly trying to keep up with the versions, setting up environment, failing to do so and then reinventing the week. A vicious tirade. So I decided against it.\nWix and other website builders Great for making websites, but terribly slow for blogs. Wanted something neat that can hold experiments and markdown. So I dropped it. BUT! made my website with it and love every bit of it. Check it out here.\nMedium I love medium. I love the aesthetics, the simplicity, the community. But the paywall, hate the paywall. I wanted something that I can call my own. So I decided against it again. But I do have some older posts on medium. Check it out here.\nFast.ai They have a pretty neat template that can set you up in minutes.It’s barebones but you can customize and go a long way. It helps you write quickly and get your content out there. I used it for a while but wanted something more customizable. Check it out here.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe most difficult part of writing your own blog is taking the first step. I know I sound like every other self-help Guru but belive me it is true. I know I will make mistakes on the way and that is FINE. So just pick the method you find easiest and suitable to your needs and get started! And don’t forget to tell me about it because I’d love to hear your stories!\nGotta end with midj image\n\n\n\nbelieve it or not, prompt is “pikachu as a jedi”",
